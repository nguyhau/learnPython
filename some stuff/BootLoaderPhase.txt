/* 1. Boot Loader Phase */
- Hardware Initialization 
    1. Configuring the CPU speed
    2. Memory initialization, such as setting up the registers, clearing the memory,
    and determining the size of the onboard memory
    3. Turning on the caches
    4. Setting up the serial port for the boot console
    5. Doing the hardware diagnostics or the POST (Power On Self-Test diagnostics)
- Downloading Kernel Image and Initial Ram Disk: 
    1. Read ELF header of Kernel Image
    2. Load kernel image into memory
    3. Load image of initial Ram Disk into memory
- Setting Up Argument
    The boot loader has to set up a memory area for argument passing, initialize it with the required data
    structures (that can be identified by the Linux kernel), and then fill them up with the required values.
- Jumping to Kernel Entry Point
    The kernel entry point is decided by the linker script when building the kernel
    Once the boot loader jumps to the kernel entry point, its job is done and it is of no use.
